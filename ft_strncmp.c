/*The ft_strncmp function compares two strings, s1 and s2, character by 
character. However, it comes with a strict leash: it will only compare up to 
a maximum of n characters.

If the strings are completely identical up to that point, it returns 0. If it 
finds a difference, it stops instantly and returns the mathematical difference 
between the first two characters that failed to match.

The Traps & Edge Cases
The Extended ASCII Trap: Standard ASCII characters (like 'A' or 'a') go from 
0 to 127. But memory can hold values up to 255 (like special accents é, ñ). If 
you use a normal signed char, anything above 127 overflows into negative 
numbers. If you subtract a negative number from a positive number, your math 
breaks entirely and you return the wrong result.

The n == 0 Gotcha: If the user passes 0 for n, it means "Compare zero bytes." 
The correct answer is always 0 (they match). If your function tries to check 
index 0 first, it will fail.

The Double \0 Illusion: What if s1 is "cat" and s2 is "catastrophe", and n is 
10? When i hits 3, s1[3] is \0 but s2[3] is 'a'. 

The Logic (Pseudo-code)
1. Did the user ask to compare 0 characters? 
   - YES: Return 0 immediately.
2. Start at the first character of both strings.
3. Keep walking forward AS LONG AS all three conditions are met:
   - We haven't hit the limit 'n'.
   - The characters in both strings are identical.
   - We haven't hit the end of string 1 ('\0').
4. The loop stopped. Why did it stop?
   - Did we hit the limit 'n'? 
     - YES: The strings are identical up to the allowed limit. Return 0.
   - NO: We stopped because we found a difference (or hit the end).
5. Grab the two mismatched characters, convert them to strictly positive 
   numbers, and subtract them. Return the result.

Line-by-Line Breakdown
int ft_strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n)

Takes two read-only strings and an unsigned limit n. Returns an int (can be 
negative, positive, or zero).

if (n == 0) return (0);

The immediate bail-out. We do absolutely nothing if n is 0.

while (i < n && s1[i] == s2[i] && s1[i] != '\0')

The triple-lock loop.

i < n: Keeps us inside the boundary.

s1[i] == s2[i]: Ensures we only move forward if the characters match.

s1[i] != '\0': Prevents us from walking off the edge of s1. (Note: We 
don't need s2[i] != '\0' because if s2 ends first, the s1[i] == s2[i] 
check will automatically fail anyway!)

i++;

Step forward to the next index.

if (i == n) return (0);

If the loop broke because our counter i reached the limit n, it means 
we successfully verified every byte up to the limit without finding a 
mismatch.

return ((unsigned char)s1[i] - (unsigned char)s2[i]);

The core calculation. We grab the specific memory boxes that failed to 
match. We forcefully cast them to unsigned char (so they are strictly 
positive numbers between 0 and 255), and subtract them.

The Theory
The Implicit int Promotion
An evaluator might look at your last line and ask: "Wait. You are 
subtracting an unsigned char from an unsigned char. In C, an unsigned 
number cannot be negative. So if s1 is 'A' (65) and s2 is 'Z' (90), 
wouldn't 65 - 90 cause an underflow and return a massive positive number?"

Your Defense: "No, because of C's implicit integer promotion. Before the 
compiler actually does the mathematical subtraction, it sees that the return 
type of the function is a standard int. It takes those two unsigned char values 
(which are 1-byte numbers) and automatically promotes them into standard 4-byte 
signed int registers inside the CPU. So the math happens as normal integers 
(65 - 90), safely resulting in -25.*/
